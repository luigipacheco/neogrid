The Neobrutal Chess Set draws inspiration from Brutalist architecture, focusing on materiality, texture, and bold monolithic forms. This minimal yet impactful design serves as a functional chess set and a striking decorative piece for any studio, living room, or office. The set captures the essence of Brutalism by emphasizing raw materials and clean lines, making it both a design statement and a tribute to the architectural movement.
