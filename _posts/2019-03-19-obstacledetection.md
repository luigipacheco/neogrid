### Role: Algorithm Designer / Programmer

- Designed and implemented an algorithm for real-time obstacle detection during 3D printing with KUKA robotic arms.
- Programmed feedback mechanisms in Grasshopper to correct the printing path in response to detected obstacles.
- Enabled precise clay printing using adaptive layer-by-layer path correction.

This project, part of the Master in Robotics and Advanced Construction at IAAC, improves the accuracy and efficiency of robotic 3D printing by adjusting the toolpath in real-time based on environmental feedback.
