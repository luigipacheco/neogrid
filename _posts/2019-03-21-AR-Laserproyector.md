## Augmented Reality Laser Projector

![AR- Laser Projector](/assets/images/laserprojector.jpg)

### Role: Developer / Researcher

- Customized Arduino sketches for laser control and interaction.
- Built a Processing-inspired library for projecting custom shapes and animations.
- Developed Python scripts for serial communication to transfer projection data.
- Implemented pan and tilt calibration using ARUCO markers and OpenCV.

This project, created during the Master in Robotics and Advanced Construction at IAAC, aimed to project 2D drawings onto 3D surfaces using a moving laser, enhancing real-time construction interaction.
