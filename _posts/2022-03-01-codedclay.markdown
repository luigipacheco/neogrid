## Coded Clay: The Fusion of Traditional Materials and Digital Fabrication

In the world of digital fabrication, the blend of traditional materials and modern technology often leads to breathtaking creations. **Coded Clay** exemplifies this fusion, merging art, mathematics, and technology into functional and aesthetic objects.

These pieces are far from ordinary pottery items; they represent the intersection of parametric design and digital fabrication. Using **Blender**, a powerful 3D modeling software, along with **Python scripting**, each object is crafted with precision and artistic flair. This technique draws inspiration from Joseph Choma's book *Morphing*, which explores the transformative power of design in architecture and art.

### The Process

The process begins by designing seamless surfaces that result in a unique, textured appearance due to the layering inherent in the 3D printing process. This project required a customized CNC machine, specifically adapted for clay printing, demonstrating the versatility of repurposing CNC technology for pottery.

### Parametric Design and Customization

Each object is generated from a distinct formula, bridging computational design with manual craftsmanship. The parametric approach allows for the modification of parameters, enabling an infinite number of variations and making mass customization possible.
