**Animaquina** is a robot Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed to control and simulate robots directly within **Blender**. By leveraging Blender’s powerful 3D capabilities, Animaquina provides a versatile and user-friendly platform for robot programming, visualization, and real-time manipulation. The IDE bridges the gap between digital simulations and physical robotic execution, making it a valuable tool for designers, engineers, and educators interested in robotics.

## Features

Animaquina offers a range of powerful features, allowing users to intuitively manage robotic simulations and operations:

- **IP-based Robot Connection**: Connect and control robots over an IP network.
- **Real-time Manipulation**: Move and adjust robots directly within Blender’s 3D viewport.
- **Digital Twin Synchronization**: Keep the digital model synchronized with the physical robot.
- **Real-time Movement Visualization**: Visualize robot movements in real time for immediate feedback.
- **Manual Mode**: Manipulate the physical robot manually, with real-time updates in the digital twin.
- **Marker Placement**: Digitize features of the working environment by placing markers in the digital model.
- **Toolpath Execution**: Create and run toolpaths based on mesh object vertices, useful for complex manufacturing tasks.
- **Info Panel**: Display the current joint rotation and TCP (Tool Center Point) position.
- **VR and XR Integration**: Integrates with Freebird XR, allowing for immersive interaction in virtual or extended reality environments.
