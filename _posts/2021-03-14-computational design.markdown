## Coded Voxels: A YouTube Channel for Computational Design

I'm excited to introduce my YouTube channel, **Coded Voxels**, where I provide a series of tutorials on computational design using Blender, Python, and Geometry Nodes. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced designer, these tutorials aim to bridge the gap between design, mathematics, and programming, providing hands-on experience with key computational design tools.

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Computational Design

In the first chapter, I walk you through the basics of Blender's interface tailored specifically for computational design. We'll dive into the core tools you need, including **Sverchok** and **Python**, to help you get started with creating and manipulating geometry.

**Topics covered:**
- Understanding basic data structures in computational design.
- Vertex and edge creation in Blender.
- Introduction to Python programming for computational geometry.

### Chapter 2: Surfaces and Mathematics

In the second chapter, I explore how to use mathematical concepts to create surfaces and shapes in Blender. Inspired by Joseph Choma’s work, this chapter dives into the practical applications of mathematical formulas for geometry manipulation.

**Topics covered:**
- Creating geometry through mathematical formulas in Python.
- Comparing NURBS and MESH modeling.
- Using Blender’s Sverchok addon for practical design applications.

### Chapter 3: To Be Announced

Stay tuned for Chapter 3, where I will explore more advanced computational design techniques. Make sure to subscribe to **Coded Voxels** to get notified when the new tutorials are released!
