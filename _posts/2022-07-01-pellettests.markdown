## Integrating Massive Dimension's Pellet Extruder with Kuka Robot

In this project, we explore interactive approaches in robotic fabrication by integrating **Massive Dimension's pellet extruder** with a **Kuka robot**. The integration employs an IoT approach through a **UDP connection**, allowing seamless communication between the extruder and the robot. This method significantly broadens the scope of experimentation in 3D printing, providing more flexibility and control over the printing process.

I developed a customized **OSC (Open Sound Control) interface**, along with **ESP32 firmware** and toolpath integration, to enhance robot control. This allows for precise synchronization between the robot and the pellet extruder, enabling real-time adjustments during fabrication.
