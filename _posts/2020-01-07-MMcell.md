The M-CELL was showcased during the KUKA Mexico Open House and the Feria De Leon 2020, where a robot drew over 500 portraits. These portraits were created using sinusoidal lines mapped to picture brightness, producing unique, artful representations.

**Key highlights:**
- Public engagement with automation and technology.
- Robotically drawn portraits using advanced sinusoidal line mapping.
- Featured at major events like KUKA Mexico Open House and Feria De Leon 2020.

This project was developed for the Secretary of Economy of the State of Guanajuato in collaboration with Karl Singline and MakerMex.
