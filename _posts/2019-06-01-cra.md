### Role: Product Designer / Programmer

- Designed the product with a focus on easy deployment in construction environments.
- Programmed the system, incorporating AI for kinematic self-calibration.
- Created an animated video to demonstrate the projectâ€™s features and use cases.

This project, developed during the third term of the Master in Robotics and Advanced Construction at IAAC, focuses on the integration of robotics in construction. The robotic assistant includes:

- A self-calibration Artificial Intelligence algorithm for kinematic calculations.
- An easy setup process for on-site mounting and real-time operation.
- Real-time data feedback from the construction site using OpenCV for enhanced decision-making and adjustments.
