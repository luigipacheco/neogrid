## Architectural Prompt Generator

### About the Project

The **Architectural Prompt Generator** is a creative tool designed to inspire architects and designers by generating unique architectural concepts. This project builds upon ideas discussed with **Marcelo Ertorteguy** and expands on his initial experiments showcased on Instagram. By randomizing architectural elements, this tool encourages creativity and helps spark innovative design ideas.

You can explore the generator on the official website: [Architectural Prompt Generator](https://www.architecturalprompt.com/).

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Generate Your Prompt

Visit the **[Architectural Prompt Generator](https://www.architecturalprompt.com/)** to create a one-of-a-kind architectural prompt. The tool randomly combines various architectural elements, generating concepts that push the boundaries of conventional design.

#### Step 2: Bring Your Prompt to Life

Once you have your generated prompt, head over to the **ArchPrompter ChatGPT Bot**. Paste your prompt into the bot, and it will visualize the concept, providing an image representation that serves as a visual aid for your architectural idea.

#### Step 3: Further Exploration

The generated image and prompt can be a starting point for further exploration. You can use other image-generation tools to expand on the concept or even begin drafting your architectural designs. Let your creativity flow as you explore new design possibilities.

#### Step 4: Share Your Creations

We love to see the incredible ideas and designs that emerge from the **Architectural Prompt Generator**. If you're on Instagram, share your creations and tag **@codedvoxels** to inspire others in the architectural community. You can also check out the architectural prompt experiments I’ve shared on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codedvoxels/). Let’s collaborate and inspire each other!
