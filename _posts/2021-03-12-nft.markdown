## NFT Experiments: 8x8x8 Animated Worlds and Generative Art

### Role: Creator / Artist

These NFT experiments merge generative modeling, digital art, and the blockchain. Each piece is part of a larger collection of unique, animated worlds with complex characters. These NFTs are released sequentiallyâ€”new assets are created only after the previous one is sold, adding a layer of exclusivity and anticipation to the project.

### World 001: Construction Site

"World 001: Construction Site" is a generative experiment using Blender's new Geometry Nodes, Blender's Python API, Sverchok, and Animation Nodes. The project explores procedural modeling techniques to generate surreal environments inhabited by unlucky characters. 

### In the Block Mine #001

This piece draws inspiration from the unpredictability of mining in a digital landscape. Each asset is procedurally generated and serves as part of a larger narrative within the 8x8x8 universe.

### The Baron: Inspired by Dune

As a fan of the Dune universe, I created a collection of NFTs that pay homage to characters from this iconic sci-fi saga, particularly inspired by Jodorowsky's unmade adaptation of Dune, and the artwork of [Moebius](https://www.heavymetal.com/news/moebius-concept-art-jodorowsky-dune-characters/) and [H.R. Giger](https://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/hr-giger).

### 001: The Baron

"Vladimir Harkonnen, Siridar of Giedi Prime and house Harkonnen," is one of my favorite characters from the original *Dune* book. His grotesque form and malevolent nature are captured in this NFT, which started as a 3D scan of a Fat Buddha sculpture and was digitally sculpted and painted to resemble Harkonnen's menacing presence.
