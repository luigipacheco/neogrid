## 3D Printed Espresso Cups: A Fusion of Craft and Technology

In the world of digital fabrication, the fusion of craft and technology brings forth a unique creation: **3D printed espresso cups**. These cups are not only functional but also serve as a showcase of the artistic potential of parametric design in clay.

Utilizing **Blender’s Sverchok**, an advanced node-based geometry tool, each espresso cup is crafted with a distinct "fingerprint." The spiralized layering technique creates a continuous line that exposes the nature of the fabrication process, blending aesthetics with functionality.

### Parametric Design with Sverchok

Sverchok enables a parametric approach to design, allowing for the creation of complex forms that are both functional and artistic. The process involves developing a toolpath for the base to ensure a watertight object, followed by a spiralized contour to generate the cup. Texturing techniques further customize each cup, making every piece unique.

### Digital Craftsmanship Meets Tradition

These espresso cups, crafted with modern digital tools and traditional materials, offer a glimpse into the future of everyday objects shaped by technology. They are not just vessels for coffee but also artifacts of digital craftsmanship—each piece representing the intersection of parametric design, 3D printing, and artisanal claywork.
