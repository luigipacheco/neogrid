## Generative Art Tool for Neon 2021 Art Festival

For the **Neon 2021 Art Festival** in Norfolk, Virginia, I developed an interactive tool using **P5.js**. This tool allows users to create abstract images through a (biased) random walking dot algorithm, demonstrating how simple computational design rules can generate complex and visually captivating results.

### Interactive Generative Art

The tool is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, offering adjustable sliders to control various aspects like the dot's movement, color palette, and trail effects. This allows for a wide range of artistic expressions, making the creation of abstract art accessible even to those without a background in programming or design.

### Try It Yourself

I encourage you to explore the tool and experiment with creating your own unique patterns and designs. You can share your creations or thoughts on how the tool can be enhanced for further artistic exploration.

### Behind the Scenes

This tool was built using **P5.js**, a powerful JavaScript library that simplifies coding for artists, designers, and educators. The underlying algorithm, a biased random walk, introduces a level of predictability to the randomness, leading to more intricate and unexpected outcomes. This combination of order and chaos forms the basis of the generative art you can create with the tool.

### Reflection

Developing this tool for the **Neon 2021 Art Festival** was both a technical and artistic challenge. It highlights the potential of computational design to push the boundaries of traditional art forms and demonstrates the creative possibilities unlocked through interactive, generative art.
