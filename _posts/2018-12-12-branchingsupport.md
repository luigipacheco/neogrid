## Targeted Random Branch Growth Algorithm

### Role: Developer / Researcher

- Developed a Python-based algorithm for Grasshopper, creating optimized 3D printing support structures.
- Implemented a self-collision avoidance system for branching support generation.
- Designed a dynamic branching system that adapts to complex geometries during printing.

This project, developed as part of the Master in Robotics and Advanced Construction at IAAC, explores innovative solutions for 3D printing support structures. It enhances efficiency in additive manufacturing through computational design.
