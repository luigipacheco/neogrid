## Above the Ground by Joyce Billet

### About the Project

I developed the **robotic 3D printing workflow** for the bench legs and planters in this project, as well as the strategy to attach the 3D-printed parts to the wooden elements. The workflow also involved texturizing the objects according to the artistâ€™s vision and creating all the necessary toolpaths for printing the components.

[**Above the Ground**](https://www.joycebillet.com/above-the-ground) is a sculptural intervention by **Joyce Billet** inc collaboration with the RDF lab, which explores the connection between the natural and the digital. In this project, the artist integrates manmade and organic elements, merging them into a single environment. Drawings and paintings of plant species informed the cuts, etchings, and sculptural forms within the installation. 

The **3D-printed vessels**, made from renewable PLA, mimic organic shapes filled with soil, questioning how humanity can coexist with nature while adapting to new mediums of evolution. These vessels function both as sculptures and as an environment for plants and humans to inhabit simultaneously.
