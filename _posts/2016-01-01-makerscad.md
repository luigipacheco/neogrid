## Introduction

**MakerSCAD** is a web-based parametric 3D creation suite that lets users **program their own worlds**. Initially known as **ScratchyCAD**, this tool brings together **computer programming** and **tangible 3D objects**. It is designed to make 3D modeling more accessible, especially for beginners, by using a **block-based coding interface**. The vision behind MakerSCAD is to blend **coding skills** with **professional-grade parametric design**, making it an educational tool for users of all ages.

MakerSCAD, formerly called ScratchyCAD, is a **parametric 3D modeling software** that uses a **block-based programming language**. This approach allows users to create 3D models by writing short snippets of code. Here’s how it works:

- **Visual Coding**: The interface is built on a block-based coding language inspired by Scratch, making it **easy to learn and intuitive** for new users.
- **Parametric Design**: Users can create **smart objects** whose geometry updates automatically when parameters or control values (CVs) are changed.
- **Coding + 3D Design**: By combining 3D modeling with coding, MakerSCAD enables users to develop programming skills while designing complex 3D models.


## Key Features

MakerSCAD’s unique features are designed to make 3D design both fun and educational:

1. **Block-Based Programming Language**
   - The coding interface is inspired by the educational tool Scratch, offering an easy entry point into coding.
2. **Real-Time Parametric Modeling**
   - Adjust parameters to instantly update 3D models. This promotes experimentation and iterative design.
3. **Web-Based Accessibility**
   - No installation required—MakerSCAD runs directly in the browser, making it highly accessible to schools and makerspaces.
4. **Interactive Learning**
   - Designed by teachers, it includes tutorials and workshops that guide users through coding and design principles simultaneously.

MakerSCAD was developed by **Juan Carlos Orozco**, while I focused on its **promotion, training, workshops**, and a **Kickstarter campaign** to boost its visibility and adoption. 

## Impact on Education and Design

MakerSCAD has had a significant impact on both **education** and **3D design**:

- **Coding Literacy**: By integrating coding into 3D design, MakerSCAD helps users develop essential coding skills in a creative context.
- **Design Thinking**: Users learn to think parametrically, an important skill in fields like architecture, engineering, and digital fabrication.
- **Tangible Outcomes**: The software bridges the gap between digital design and physical creation, allowing users to 3D print their designs or incorporate them into larger projects.
