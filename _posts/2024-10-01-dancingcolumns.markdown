## Dancing Columns: Equation-based Robotic Fabrication

### About the Project

This gallery showcases an exploration of robotic 3D printed objects generated from mathematical equations, created by [**Joseph Choma**](https://designtopology.com/) and **Luis Pacheco**, with fabrication support from the RDF Lab at FIU. The featured objects are derived from a family of morphed toruses, where altering the parameters of the equations results in captivating and unexpected geometric features. These forms emerge from a complex interplay of sine and cosine functions, with variables manipulated to produce intricate, undulating surfaces. This collaboration bridges the gap between digital design and physical manifestation, highlighting the artistic potential of mathematical equations to create dynamic, organic forms.

A deeper study of these geometric transformations can be found in "Morphing: A Guide to Mathematical Transformations for Architects and Designers" by Joseph Choma, which delves into the processes and theories behind these mathematical explorations.
