# About Me

Hello! I'm Luis Pacheco, a  Robotics and Digital Fabrication Research Specialist and DDES candidate at Florida International University, specifically working within the School of Architecture and the Robotics and Digital Fabrication Lab (RDF Lab). . At the heart of my research lies a keen interest in pioneering workflows that integrate additive manufacturing in construction and developing intuitive robot control interfaces.

My academic background includes a master's degree in Robotics and Advanced Construction from the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) in Barcelona, and a bachelor’s degree in Architecture from Universidad de La Salle Bajio in Mexico. 
 I co-founded MakerMex, Mexico’s first 3D printer manufacturing company. As CEO, I led a diverse team in developing a range of products including 3D printers, laser cutters, and customized robotic systems for over eight years. My commitment to the maker movement and digital fabrication extended beyond MakerMex, leading to the co-foundation of initiatives such as MakerLab Leon and MakerScad a parametric 3D modeling software using blocks, imagine OpenSCAD + Scratch.

In 2016  I was recognized as one of Mexico’s MIT Innovators under 35, I believe in the power of technology to transform our world . I'm excited to share my journey and insights with you through my FabAcademy portfolio. 

Currently I am developing animaquina, a Blender addon for moving robots with Blender. Using a digital twin it simplifies the process for path planning and toolpathing generation and simulation.
